            <div class="history-content">
                <p>Since its establishment in 1980, ZooParc Zoological Park has been a leader in wildlife conservation and education. From humble beginnings, we have grown to house over 2,000 animals across 200 species. Our zoo covers 70 hectares of natural habitats, carefully designed to mimic the wild environments of our animal residents. Over the years, we have developed numerous educational programs and conservation initiatives that have had a positive impact both locally and globally.</p>
